# HuggingFace Downloader (HFDL)

Welcome to the **HuggingFace Downloader Deluxe (HFDL)**, the only tool you'll ever need to download models from HuggingFace with more flair than a peacock at a bird show! ü¶ö

## What is HFDL?

HFDL is a Node.js script that's as eager to download HuggingFace models as a kid in a candy store. It's like a digital treasure hunter, but instead of gold, it's after those precious model files.
Since I don't like the "HF way", here is a faster way to download a full directory from HF using aria2c for speed.

## Features

- **Command-line savvy**: Just give it a HuggingFace repo, and it'll do the rest.
- **Directory support**: Want to organize your downloads? HFDL respects your need for order in the chaos of your filesystem.
- **Dry run option**: Just testing the waters? HFDL can simulate downloads for you, because who doesn't like a good dress rehearsal?
- **Aria2 integration**: This script is best buddies with Aria2, ensuring your downloads are faster than a cheetah.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Node.js and Aria2 installed.
2. Clone this repo..
3. Run the script with the following command:
   ```bash
   node hfdl.js <HFUser/repo> [directory]

Replace <HFUser/repo> with the HuggingFace repository you want to clone, and [directory] with the place you want to stash your loot.

Example
node hfdl.js zibri/awesome-model-2024 models

If the directory is not specified, the directory will be listed with all the direct links.
